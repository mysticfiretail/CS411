Tech Stack:
Which is the technology stack of flask (python), MySQL, and HTML with some CSS framework. We chose this technology stock because one of our members already knows how to use my schedules, so having that familiarity we felt would benefit us. We also chose fast because most of our members have used flask and additionally to the ones that haven’t used plus have used python. They are such as HTML and CSS because there are a lot of resources for it on the Internet so he felt that it would be more easily accessible to everybody. We previously considered mongoDB and Django as part of our technology stack however, mongoDB was a new concept for all of our members and we didn’t want to get stuck behind minute errors. Same goes for why we didn’t choose Django, only one of our members has ever used Django and we wanted to make sure that the project was accessible to all of our members for ease of access, since we were already learning many new things regarding APIs and OAUTH tokens.
